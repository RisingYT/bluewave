# bluewave
Your average Arch-based Linux distribution.

It comes in three editions: Tsunami, Splash, and Flow.

Want a standard Linux distribution with what you'd probably want? Go for the Tsunami edition!

Want a lightweight edition if yours could probably fry eggs by now? The Splash edition has got your back!

Want to take it to the max and brag about how great you are when it comes to using Linux? The Flow edition hears you, and it's there for that! (Coming soon).

Yes! All of the three editions are available for just... How much did you guess?

Five hundred? A thousand? EVEN MORE?! No, it's costs nothing! That's right it's free! It's an incredible opportunity but it's true! No more to stupid paid licenses and telemetry spying on you! It's Blue Wave made by your's truly. You can download it now today!

But except in Pyongyang.

Also credits to the Arch Linux GUI project because it has some code from it.
