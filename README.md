# bluewave
Your average Linux distribution.

Blue Wave is Arcb-based BTW. Meaning that it uses the 'pacman' package manager! (but i'm sure you'd expect that by now) 

It comes in two editions: Tsunami and Splash.

Want a standard Linux distribution with what you'd probably want? Go for the Tsunami edition.

Want a lightweight edition if yours could probably fry eggs by now? The Splash edition has got your back!

COMING SOON ON MAY 29 BOIII

Also credits to the Arch Linux GUI project because it has some code from it.
