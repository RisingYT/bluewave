# bluewave
Your average Linux distribution.

Blue Wave is Arcb-based BTW. Meaning that it uses the 'pacman' package manager! (but i'm sure you'd expect that by now) 

It comes in two desktop environments: XFCE and LXQT.

YOOOO IT HAS THE CHAOTIC-AUR REPO ASWELL

But you may ask about the system requirements. I have no idea to be honest what it'll be.

NOTE: The project is currently in beta. So yes, bugs do happen here and there.
